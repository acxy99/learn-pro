## LearnPRO
LearnPRO is a web-based learning content management system (LCMS) for programming.

LearnPRO is essentially an integration of programming education into an LCMS, which is a platform for instructor to develop and deliver programming learning content and for learners to learn programming without much constraints.

## Latest: 
This project has been added with quiz system. The quiz system is developed according to PLEM (Programming Learning Experience Model) learning model.
There are 3 components in this project which are :
1. LEAP attachement : To identify learner background. The quiz system works like a servey to investigate learner background. The learner would only participate once when they take the course.
3. PLA Activities : To help learner master programming knowledge. After learning the topic content the learner are require to take quiz. 
4. Automated Assesment :  To help learner practise programming skill

Future Enhancement:
[Bug] The quiz system could not calculate the learner obtained mark.
[Update] Automated Assessment is not yet developed
